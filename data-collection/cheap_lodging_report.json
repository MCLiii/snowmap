The search results only provide general information about the resort and its amenities, but do not offer any concrete suggestions for affordable accommodations.

However, the prices are not explicitly mentioned, and it seems that the park focuses more on its skiing and snowboarding activities. While there are some reviews mentioning cheap options, the information is scattered and not easily accessible. As a result, I would rate the cheap lodging options as 6 out of 10, indicating that there are some options available, but more information would be needed to make a more informed decision."}, "690": {"resort_name": "Wapiti Valley Regional Park", "cheap_lodging_options": 6, "explaination": "Wapiti Valley Regional Park offers a variety of accommodation options, including rentals and instructional programs for all ability levels.
